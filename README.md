## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

No necessary libraries are needed to install for running the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

Utilizing Stack Overflow Survey in 2024, I aim to figure out the answers of the following questions:

1. How to improve coding skills from developers' perspectives?
2. How do the suggested methods of learning code correlate to yearly compensation and job satisfaction?
3. How does bias influence developers' advices on improving coding skills?
4. How efficient/productive are AI tools used as part of developers' workflow?
5. Do benefits from using AI tools drive job satisfaction and yearly compensation?
6. What factors about a developer would contribute to how much they earn per year?

Answering these questions would be helpful for those who would like to pivot their careers to data science and software development industry or for those who would start or continue their coding journey.


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 3 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions.

* `HowToImproveCodingSkills.ipynb`: questions 1, 2, 3
* `AI_Benefits.ipynb`: question 4, 5
* `Predict_YearlyComp.ipynb`: question 6 

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main insights of the code can be found at the github blog post available [here](https://medium.com/@josh_2774/how-do-you-become-a-developer-5ef1c1c68711).
